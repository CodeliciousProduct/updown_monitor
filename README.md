# Updown Status Page

## How it works

Fetches updown.io's API via the read only key and populates the page
<br>
Page is written in Vue.js for fun

## Build Setup (only for development)

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm i

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm start

# check vue and js syntax
npm lint

# build for production with minification
npm build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm build --report
```
